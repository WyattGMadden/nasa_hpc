notes
- made distance calculation more efficient

Q's 

- prediction data set contains locations equal to monitor locations, resulting in prediction NA's. change data, or change code?

- issue in ensemble fit
    - currently are dropping spatial locations with num.obs < num.cv.folds for cv fit.
        need to account for this in matching scheme for ensemble fit code
    - quick fix would be to fillter out monitors with insuffient obs, but need to think of downstream effects later and maybe add warning
        - added error in grm_cv - does not permit number of obs within each space id < cv fold number
    - this is actually an issue even for temporal NA padding, because there aren't equal number of pad NA's between aod and cmaq    
        -fixed this 



meeting 20250124
- funding next year? statistics post doc goal. 
- Can we do 2 aims together, and other related to health or whatever?
- who to put on comittee?
PAPER
- 

PAPER TODO 
- add data page (based off danlu fire paper) to supp info
- add table fitting details (km, cor, etc) to sup info
- make github page just for remote sensing paper
    - full code script (run all models, recreate figures/tables, read in data from dataverse)
- put on CRAN
- paragraph on potential next steps
- need zenodo data documentation info. verify with howard (authors + description)




AIMS NOTES

ensemble
    -addressing preferential missingness, multi-resolution, etc


look into nngp for multi dimension (beyond space and time), 
    - and do variable selection on dimension? ie collapse some dimenions
        - previous work is typically nonbayesian? like vechia? 
    - nngp has strong isotropic component which might not work for large datasets
        - how to relax this for nngp? fancier deformation


meeting 20240125 notes
Qs
    - looks like UNC affiliates cannot create dataverses but can contribute? Do we have a dataverse?

- howard is here april 10th, 11th, 14th, 15th

NNGP 


AIM 3
- get citi certification
- beyond R2 - (R5, R10)
- in higher dimension, how do you find the conditional set? 
    -matthias katzfuss, joe guiness
- use dimension reduction first and then project to 2d space
- look at mathius
