notes
- made distance calculation more efficient

Q's 

- prediction data set contains locations equal to monitor locations, resulting in prediction NA's. change data, or change code?

- issue in ensemble fit
    - currently are dropping spatial locations with num.obs < num.cv.folds for cv fit.
        need to account for this in matching scheme for ensemble fit code
    - quick fix would be to fillter out monitors with insuffient obs, but need to think of downstream effects later and maybe add warning
        - added error in grm_cv - does not permit number of obs within each space id < cv fold number
    - this is actually an issue even for temporal NA padding, because there aren't equal number of pad NA's between aod and cmaq    
        -fixed this 



meeting 20250124
- funding next year? statistics post doc goal
PAPER
- 

PAPER TODO 
- add table fitting details (km, cor, etc) to sup info
- make github page just for remote sensing paper
    - full code script (run all models, recreate figures/tables, read in data from dataverse)
- put on CRAN
